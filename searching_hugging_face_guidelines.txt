In order to beging training Natural Language Inference Models in Portuguese I 
need to accomplish the following goals:
#1 Finding Natural Language Inference (NLI) datasets in Portuguese
#2 Finding Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to train on such datasets

Both goals are related to making searches and therefore I'll be using the 
HuggingFaceAPI (HFApi) to help me with that given that HuggingFace is the 
platform from where I'll be getting the data and the models.

But how can HFApi help in such searches?

HFApi is a Python class with the following methods:

-dataset_info(repo_id: str, ...):  given the id of a repository available in HF,
I can get information about datasets and models [GOAL #1, #2];
-get_dataset_tags(repo_id: str, ...): gets all valid dataset tags as a nested 
namespace object
    - Perform searches on datasets' TAGS
- get_model_tags(repo_id: str, ...) : same as get_dataset_tags, but for models
    - Perform searches on models' TAGS
-  list_datasets(filter, ...): gets all valid model tags as a nested namespace 
object based on a filter.
    - Can perform searches for datasets using their TAGS as filters
- list_models(filter, ...): same as list_datasets, but for models
    - Can perform searches for models using their TAGS as filters
- get_repo_discussions(repo_id: str, ...): fetches Discussions and Pull 
Requests for the given repo.
